1. Overall code in not consistent for example
    1. Using different case(camel, snake) for variable definition
    2. Naming convention not right
2. Data Layer (Repository) should be responsible for only data handling
3. Data Layer (Repository) should not have business logic
4. Business logic should be in service
5. Request Should be responsible for data validation
6. Some issues with data protection and security
7. There is lot commented code that should be removed.
8. Lot of missing null check pointer that can produce errors in future
9. Should use try catch blocks 
10. Maintaining this type of code is tough
11. I saw some logic issue but i did not have task requirement thats why i am not sure about them  
12. Response is not consistent. It should be the same through out the application


Note: I added comments between code with details about changes.

Because there is a lot of code that need to be refactored and requirement are not given
for these reasons i was not able to refactor the most of the given code.
